# Heart_Health

## Details of the task

The main aim of the task is to create a well accurate machine learning model for finding the probability for having a heart attack based on several attributes that is obtained from a dataset and integrate the resulting information that is obtained onto an online platform.

## File formats

The dataset that is used for training is of CSV format. The input is read in the form of a url and output is given in a JSON format. A combination of different libraries in Python will be used for implementing this task.


## Running the python file

* Run the python file
* Use the link (http://127.0.0.1:5000/recommend/age_value=56&sex_value=1&cp_value=1&trestbps_value=140&chol_value=290&fbs_value=1&rest_ecg_value=1&thalach_value=140&exang_value=1&oldpeak_value=0&slope_value=0&ca_value=0&thal_value=1) where the values after the '=' sign can be changed in order to see a change in the output.
* Alternatively one can also edit the code in the python file (line 45 - app.run()) where a desired address could be provided (If this change is made, the same address should be used in place of the address given in the link above).
